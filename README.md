# STM32_HRTIM_Examples

STM32 Atollic tips:

1. Can rename the project, but it will create copy of it. But I cannot find the folder location of it.
2. .cproject is Atollic Project file, the last folder name of the imported folder will be the project name. but may have problem that some files are not added.
